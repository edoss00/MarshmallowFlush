Received input from The SIMPsons and Eclipse.

The SIMPsons
 - Lack of arrows on site map
 - Consider using one database/file type for all sources
 - Liked our diagrams/thorough descriptions

Eclipse
 - Issue with repo structure
 - Lack of arrows on site map
 - Lack of database table
 - Elaborate the purpose of our API
 - Our doc was very thorough and looked well thought out

Design Doc Changes:
  - Added arrows to site map
  - Clarified use of API in site components

Timeline:
  - We requested to have the due date on May 11th, so we are on track and don't need to make major
changes to our plan of action. Everyone will be able to start coding today. Once data processing is
handled we will be able to implement D3 and start frontend design. Our simulation is more isolated
so it can be developed at its own pace.
