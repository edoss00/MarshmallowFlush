Added starter kit, linked submod, and created devlog

elizabethD -- 2020-04-27 23:35
Added design doc and API KB card

elizabethD -- 2020-04-28 09:27
Fixed repo structure and README

Received input from The SIMPsons and Eclipse.

The SIMPsons
 - Lack of arrows on site map
 - Consider using one database/file type for all sources
 - Liked our diagrams/thorough descriptions

Eclipse
 - Issue with repo structure
 - Lack of arrows on site map
 - Lack of database table
 - Elaborate the purpose of our API
 - Our doc was very thorough and looked well thought out

Design Doc Changes:
  - Added arrows to site map
  - Clarified use of API in site components

Timeline:
  - We requested to have the due date on May 11th, so we are on track and don't need to make major
changes to our plan of action. Everyone will be able to start coding today. Once data processing is
handled we will be able to implement D3 and start frontend design. Our simulation is more isolated
so it can be developed at its own pace.

Added requirements and team flag

Added code in __init__.py to fetch data from 2 APIs. Downloaded csv file containing US case data by state.

elizabethD -- 2020-05-03 20:18
Created d3 branch and added starter line graph code

laurenP -- 2020-05-04 00:12
Added functions to parse data from the 2 APIs and adds each country’s daily case numbers together to get a total.

amandaC -- 2020-05-04 21:35
Added basic code for line graph and maps. Edited code to fit our data.

Built SVG framework in which the simulation will run. Wrote setup and “wiggle” functions for placing humans in the world and allowing them to move randomly around, in a way that can be complicated with future variables.

laurenP -- 2020-05-04 09:00
Wrote function to get the number of new cases and death by state for the most recent date.

amandaC -- 2020-05-05 22:56
Finished code for line graph. Added buttons to test if the line graph works. Line graph can now transition between confirmed, deaths, and recovered.

elizabethD -- 2020-05-06 00:28
Tested and highlighted errors, connected flask to html pages

amandaC -- 2020-05-06 23:54
Connected line graph javascript to html and flask app. Added new functions to count global cases, country data, and country list. Changed homepage to show total coronavirus cases. Added function to change countries for line graph.

amandaC - -2020-05-07 00:30:58
Fixed small bug when loading line graph data from all countries

kiranV -- 2020-05-07 07:36
Built ‘infection’ aspect of simulation so that infection spreads from human to human. So far unoptimized but successfully selecting ‘neighbor’ humans; experimented with values to find reasonable default spread speed.
