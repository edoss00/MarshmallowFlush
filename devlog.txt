Received input from The SIMPsons and Eclipse.
- The SIMPsons - Pointed out lack of arrows on site map and to consider using one database/file type
for all sources. They liked our diagrams/thorough descriptions.
- Eclipse - Noted an issue with repo structure. Pointed out lack of arrows on site map and lack of
 database table. They also said to elaborate the purpose of our API. They thought our doc was very
 thorough and looked well thought out.
Design Doc Changes:
  - Added arrows to site map
  - Clarified use of API in site components
Timeline:
  - We requested to have the due date on May 11th, so we are on track and don't need to make major
changes to our plan of action. Everyone will be able to start coding today. Once data processing is
handled we will be able to implement D3 and start frontend design. Our simulation is more isolated
so it can be developed at its own pace.
