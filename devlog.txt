Added starter kit, linked submod, and created devlog

elizabethD -- 2020-04-27 23:35
Added design doc and API KB card

elizabethD -- 2020-04-28 09:27
Fixed repo structure and README

Received input from The SIMPsons and Eclipse.

The SIMPsons
 - Lack of arrows on site map
 - Consider using one database/file type for all sources
 - Liked our diagrams/thorough descriptions

Eclipse
 - Issue with repo structure
nnn - Lack of arrows on site map
 - Lack of database table
 - Elaborate the purpose of our API
 - Our doc was very thorough and looked well thought out

Design Doc Changes:
  - Added arrows to site map
  - Clarified use of API in site components

Timeline:
  - We requested to have the due date on May 11th, so we are on track and don't need to make major changes to our plan of action. Everyone will be able to start coding today. Once data processing is handled we will be able to implement D3 and start frontend design. Our simulation is more isolated so it can be developed at its own pace.

elizabethD -- 2020-04-30 15:04
Added requirements and team flag

laurenP -- 2020-05-01 08:18
Added code in __init__.py to fetch data from 2 APIs. Downloaded csv file containing US case data by state.marsh

elizabethD -- 2020-05-03 20:18
Created d3 branch and added starter line graph code

laurenP -- 2020-05-04 00:12
Added functions to parse data from the 2 APIs and adds each country’s daily case numbers together to get a total.

amandaC -- 2020-05-04 21:35
Added basic code for line graph and maps. Edited code to fit our data.

kiranV -- 2020-05-04 08:16
Built SVG framework in which the simulation will run. Wrote setup and “wiggle” functions for placing humans in the world and allowing them to move randomly around, in a way that can be complicated with future variables.

laurenP -- 2020-05-04 09:00
Wrote function to get the number of new cases and death by state for the most recent date.

amandaC -- 2020-05-05 22:56
Finished code for line graph. Added buttons to test if the line graph works. Line graph can now transition between confirmed, deaths, and recovered.

elizabethD -- 2020-05-06 00:28
Tested and highlighted errors, connected flask to html pages

laurenP -- 2020-05-06 08:21
Made json request code compatible with Python 3.

laurenP -- 2020-05-06 16:56
Added template html page, added script/stylesheet code and connected it to other existing pages.

amandaC -- 2020-05-06 23:54
Connected line graph javascript to html and flask app. Added new functions to count global cases, country data, and country list. Changed homepage to show total coronavirus cases. Added function to change countries for line graph.

laurenP -- 2020-05-07 08:17
Created website logo in WordArt, imported and added to template. Fixed bug in accessing states csv file.

amandaC -- 2020-05-07 20:58
Fixed small bug when loading line graph data from all countries

kiranV -- 2020-05-07 07:36
Built ‘infection’ aspect of simulation so that infection spreads from human to human. So far unoptimized but successfully selecting ‘neighbor’ humans; experimented with values to find reasonable default spread speed.

laurenP -- 2020-05-08 09:08
Added Navbar with image to template html file. Added global counter to homepage with toggling numbers to count up. Cleaned up titles on homepage.

amandaC -- 2020-05-09 10:40
Started the state bubble map and world color map by reading the sample code and the QAF post about making maps. Added coronavirus data to sample code.

laurenP -- 2020-05-10 00:40
Added Bootstrap radio buttons to select line graph display (confirmed, deaths, recovered). Improved frontend of global counter and form to select data display on homepage. Spent a long time trying to implement code on line graphs to show data points on mouse-over, but it didn’t work. Moved python data functions to separate file.

laurenP -- 2020-05-10 10:33
Found color scheme for website, changed text, background, navbar, and d3 elements to match theme. Changed formatting of counter to look cleaner. Removed background of logo image.

elizabethD -- 2020-05-10 13:55
Fixed launch instructions, updated design doc

Design Doc Updates:
- Removed coronainfo page from site map
- Updated capabilities of line graph and simulation

amandaC -- 2020-05-10 20:34
Finished state bubble map and decided to change csv to include county data instead of state data to make it look better. Added a small legend for bubble size (the make uses a square root scale).

amandaC -- 2020-05-10 22:22
Finished the world color map and added it to the page. Hovering over a country will give the new number of deaths.

laurenP -- 23:35
Separated world and US map to 2 different paths, adjusted javascript and html files. Added dropdown menu to navbar for maps. Fixed bug in dropdown.

amandaC -- 2020-05-11 00:44
Fixed scale of world map so colors are more distinguishable. Added margins to most elements. Added a legend to the world map. Alphabetized dropdown menu on home page.

kiranV -- 2020-05-11 06:40
Fixed issues with “social distancing” aspect of simulation. Created HTML form to adjust variables from front end, and linked to existing global variables. Added explanatory text to HTML template.
